        <p class="docs-intro">
            HepaCheck is a machine learning-powered system designed to assist in the early detection of liver cirrhosis using non-invasive clinical and laboratory data.
        </p>

        <div class="docs-block">
            <h2 class="docs-subtitle">Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>
                Liver cirrhosis is a critical health condition that is often diagnosed at a late stage due to the invasive and time-consuming nature of traditional methods. This delays treatment and worsens outcomes. HepaCheck aims to transform liver disease diagnosis by offering fast, accessible, and non-invasive early prediction using AI.

        <div class="docs-block">
            <h2 class="docs-subtitle">Use Cases</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Enable early, non-invasive diagnosis of liver cirrhosis by healthcare professionals</li>
                <li>Support hospital systems to triage high-risk patients effectively</li>
                <li>Integrate with telehealth platforms to offer remote liver health monitoring</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="docs-block">
            <h2 class="docs-subtitle">How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                Users input basic clinical values into the prediction form. The system processes this data through a trained machine learning model which evaluates patterns indicative of cirrhosis. Results are displayed instantly with a confidence score, helping users make informed decisions or seek medical advice.

  <h2 class="docs-subtitle">Model Documentation</h2>
  <p>
    The liver cirrhosis prediction model is a supervised machine learning classifier trained on clinical data. It takes multiple biomarkers and lifestyle features as input and predicts the likelihood of liver cirrhosis.
  </p>

  <h2 class="docs-subtitle">Model Type</h3>
  <p>
    We use a <strong>Random Forest Classifier</strong> due to its robustness, high accuracy, and ability to handle missing or imbalanced data.
  </p>

  <h2 class="docs-subtitle">Features Used</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Total Bilirubin</li>
    <li>Direct & Indirect Bilirubin</li>
    <li>SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT)</li>
    <li>Albumin, Globulin, Total Protein</li>
    <li>Platelet Count, PCV (%)</li>
    <li>Alcohol consumption (duration & quantity)</li>
    <li>Age, Diabetes status, Blood Pressure</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="docs-block">
  <h2 class="docs-subtitle">Feature Importance</h2>
  <p>The chart below visualizes how much each input feature contributed to the model's prediction.</p>
  <div class="chart-wrapper">
    <canvas id="featureChart" data-importance='{{ feature_data | safe }}'></canvas>
  </div>
</div>




  <h2 class="docs-subtitle">Training Dataset</h3>
  <p>
    The model was trained on a cleaned and preprocessed dataset consisting of anonymized patient records. The dataset was balanced using SMOTE, and features were scaled using StandardScaler.
  </p>

  <h2 class="docs-subtitle">Limitations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>This tool is not a replacement for clinical diagnosis.</li>
    <li>The prediction may vary based on data quality or rare outliers.</li>
    <li>Medical consultation is strongly recommended for confirmed results.</li>
  </ul>
